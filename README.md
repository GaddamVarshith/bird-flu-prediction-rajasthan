# Rajasthan Bird Flu Prediction

## Overview

Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a highly contagious viral infection that primarily affects birds. In recent years, there have been concerns about the spread of bird flu and its potential impact on public health, agriculture, and the economy.

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of bird flu outbreaks in different regions of Rajasthan, India. By analyzing historical data on bird flu outbreaks along with various environmental and geographical factors, we aim to identify patterns and factors contributing to the spread of bird flu. The ultimate goal is to provide early warnings and recommendations to relevant authorities for effective prevention and control measures.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about bird flu outbreaks in Rajasthan, including the date, location, strain, number of affected birds, and measures taken. Additional environmental and geographical data, such as weather conditions and migratory bird patterns, may also be included for analysis.

## Methodology

We will follow the standard data science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, will be explored and compared for their predictive performance.
